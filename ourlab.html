            Molecular Biology Lab is a research laboratory of the Department of
            Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Dhaka. Young
            enthusiastic researchers are working in this lab to uncover the
            mysteries of molecular biology.

            The scintillating journey of Molecular Biology Lab commenced in 1994
            under the auspices of Professor Haseena Khan. The lab was established
            with the goal of pioneering research in Molecular Biology in
            Bangladesh. The lab first started its research activity with nodule
            bacteria. The transition to Jute research started in 1999 with the
            Jute Genome Project which aimed at unveiling the genomic mystery of
            Jute. The Project started with studies and investigation of different
            molecular markers through RAPD and RFLP analysis.

            Professor Muhammad Riazul Islam joined the lab in 2013 and laid the
            groundwork for jute endophyte identification. Since then, the lab has
            extended its research work on jute endophytic microbiota and
            observed many promising outcomes.

            Molecular Biology has made so many illustrious contributions to
            Bangladesh in the field of Jute Research. The contribution of the
            lab stretches from developing a cold-tolerant variety of jute to
            characterizing the molecular markers of Jute. Currently, it has
            undertaken the daunting feat of unmasking the genome of Hilsa fish
            which is also the national fish of Bangladesh.

          <p class="ourlab_main_text">
            Through the application of next-generation sequencing and
            bioinformatics, the lab aims to answer many intriguing questions
            concerning Hilsa fish. The lab also has a strong interest in fungal
            extraction, novel metabolites, big data analysis, crop production
            improvement, bioinoculants, and novel antibiotics.
